This is for communicating to an Arduino via serial port. I can use this via RaspberryPi or my laptop.
I wanted to store this code so everyone can find this easily (And so I can find this easily).
Its very intuitive but only with the Arduino Code.
I am attaching it as well so it can understood (Eventually I got ADHD so who knows when I'll get to it).

Essentially you connect to the port your arduino is connected to and send strings thats about it.
Your arduino needs to be programmed to response to the SPECIFIC case that it recives.

If you send 'on' on your laptop and your Arduino is waiting for 'On' welp its not gonna work.
So keep this in mind, I don't know if this code is everywhere and everyone knows about it but in case this isn't true here yall go.
